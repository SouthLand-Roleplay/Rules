    <h2>/me's and /do's</h2>
    <small>The Correct Way To Use /me, /ame, /my & /do Within Roleplay​.</small>
    <p>I'm going to make a short simple guide on how to correctly use /me's & /do's within roleplay. I'll be listing examples so you can get a better understanding on how to separate the two from each other. Refrain from swearing in your /me, /ame, /my & /do as that is the incorrect way to engage into roleplay.</p>
    <p>/me - are usually used to describe your side of roleplay, your character, your actions, etc. When using a /me, please ensure that the first word is ALWAYS lowercase due to when you hit ENTER on a /me, your character name already starts the /me sentence off with your Firstname Lastname in capital letters. Also, please ensure there is a period at the end of your /me to complete the sentence. There shouldn't be any scenarios where a question mark (?) or exclamation point (!) is needed in a /me, they should always end in a period. You could also use /ame instead of /me which will place the /me above your character instead of in the chat. Beware, only people close to you could see this action. If they are too far, the text above your character will be too small to read. Try to be descriptive as possible in your /me. You could also use a /my, which is a /me that claims ownership over something in your actions.</p>

    <p>Correct Way To Use A /me, /ame, /my (simple):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>/me places his hands into his pockets.</li>
        <li>/me shakes the male's hand.</li>
        <li>/me scans the environment out of paranoia.</li>
        <li>/me bends down and ties her shoes.</li>
        <li>/me smells the marijuana in the air.</li>
        <li>/me yanks up his Dickies branded jeans.</li>
        <li>/me spots Delonte across the street.</li>
        <li>/ame keeps her eyes focused on the road while she drives.</li>
        <li>/ame keeps her hand in the Doritos branded bag of chips.</li>
        <li>/my bucket had would be red.</li>
        <li>/my pants would be sagging.</li>
        <li>/my feet would stink when he removes his shoes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>How The /me, /ame, /my Would Look In-Game:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>* Julius Bishop places his hands into his pockets.</li>
        <li>* Keenan Johnson shakes the male's hand.</li>
        <li>* Corey Blackburn scans the environment out of paranoia.</li>
        <li>* Latasha Black bends down and ties her shoes.</li>
        <li>* Queen Pickens smells the marijuana in the air.</li>
        <li>* Fred Bivens yanks up his Dickies branded jeans.</li>
        <li>* Kyle Mason spots Delonte across the street.</li>
        <li>* Kathy Louis keeps her eyes focused on the road while she drives. (/ame - appears above your character)</li>
        <li>* Fredricka Simmons keeps her hand in the Doritos labeled bag of chips. (/ame - appears above your character)</li>
        <li>* Pheonix German's bucket hat would be red. (/my - shows your character's ownership over something in roleplay)</li>
        <li>* Andre Nelson's pants would be sagging. (/my - shows your character's ownership over something in roleplay)</li>
        <li>* Jayson Simmons' feet would stink when he removes his shoes. (/my - shows your character's ownership over something in roleplay)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Incorrect Way To Use A /me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>/me Jumps over the gate.</li>
        <li>/me picks up the fucking gun.</li>

        <li>/ame You just killed me wtf.</li>
        <li>/my knocks the guy out.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>/do - are usually used to describe a scene within roleplay that your GTA character can't do or usually see upon engaging in a roleplay scenario. When using a /do, please ensure that the first word in the /do is ALWAYS capital due to the first word being the beginning of the sentence. When using a /do, you can use question marks (?) to question roleplay and periods (.) to describe roleplay on your end. If you're not certain what's going on within roleplay, you can use a /do to figure out what your character see, hear, smell, etc. by asking a question like the examples below. You use periods in /do when you are describing your side of roleplay, your character, your personal belongings, etc.</p>

    <p>Correct Way To Use A /do (simple /do):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>/do Would the male have a pulse?</li>
        <li>/do Would he catch the football?</li>
        <li>/do There would be chips all over the floor.</li>
        <li>/do You would see blood pouring for his arm.</li>
        <li>/do There would be three slices of pizza in the box.</li>
        <li>/do Mason's shoes would be untied.</li>
        <li>/do Hector's flag would be tied tight around his head.</li>
        <li>/do Would he make the shot?</li>
        <li>/do What would Quinn see?</li>
        <li>/do The back left tire on the Sentinel would be flat.</li>
        <li>/do Which tired would be flat on the vehicle?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>How The /do's Would Look In-Game:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>* Would the male have a pulse? (( Kwesi Johnson ))</li>
        <li>* Would he catch the football? (( Johnathan Mitchell ))</li>

    </ul>
